# Early_Test_Effort_Estimation_using_Uml_Models
This project aims at estimating the test effort in the early stage of software development life cycle i.e., when the UML diagrams are ready. While requirement elicitation is captured through a use case diagram, detail design information is provided in class diagrams. Both the diagrams are converted into XMI format which is given as input to a parser program which will identify the components of the system. The UCD is given as an input to the system and after processing, the output will be generated. Then unadjusted test points and adjusted test point will be estimated which will give us the test effort. Then we classify whether the project must be carried out or not depending upon it's Test Effort.
